  <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
  <p>
    This project presents an interactive Bank Loan Analysis dashboard built using Power BI to evaluate loan applications, funded amounts, 
    repayment performance, and credit risk. The dashboard provides a consolidated view of good vs bad loans, borrower characteristics, loan purposes,
     and repayment trends to support data-driven lending and risk management decisions.

  <h3>Business Problem</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Banks and financial institutions need to continuously monitor their loan portfolio health to reduce defaults and improve profitability. Key challenges include:
     <ul>
    <li>Identifying high-risk loans and borrowers</li>
    <li>Tracking good vs bad loan performance</li>
    <li>Monitoring funded vs received amounts</li>
    <li>Understanding how factors like loan purpose, term, grade, employment length, and geography impact repayment behavior</li>
    </ul>  
    </li>
    </ul>
   <p>Without a centralized analytical view, decision-makers lack visibility into credit risk exposure and portfolio performance.</p>

  <h3>Methodology</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cleaned and prepared historical loan data including loan amount, interest rate, DTI, loan status, borrower profile, and repayment details.</li>
    <li>Created DAX measures to calculate:
    <ul>
    <li>Total Loan Applications</li>
    <li>Total Funded Amount</li>
    <li>Total Received Amount</li>
    <li>Average Interest Rate</li>
    <li>Average Debt-to-Income (DTI)</li>
    <li>Month-over-Month (MoM) and Month-to-Date (MTD) metrics</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Classified loans into Good Loans (Fully Paid, Current) and Bad Loans (Charged Off).</li>
    <li>Designed a multi-page Power BI dashboard (Summary, Overview, Details) for different analytical needs.</li>
