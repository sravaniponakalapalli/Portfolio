<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
  <p>
    This project analyzes historical Nifty stock data to evaluate performance, volatility, drawdowns, 
    and risk-adjusted returns using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to help investors understand 
    not just which stocks are generating returns, but how much risk is involved in achieving those returns.
    The dashboard combines return metrics, volatility measures, Sharpe Ratio, market breadth, and drawdown analysis 
    to provide a complete view of market health and investment efficiency.

 <!-- Introduction -->
  <h3>What This Dashboard Is About</h3>
  
  <p>
    This dashboard analyzes Nifty stocks to answer three important investment questions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Which stocks are performing well?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>How risky are they?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Is the return worth the risk?</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Instead of looking only at returns, this dashboard combines performance, volatility, drawdowns, 
    and risk-adjusted metrics to give a complete view of the market.
  </p>

<h3>Project Objective</h3>
<p>
The objective of this project is to analyze Nifty stocks by combining return and risk metrics 
into a single interactive dashboard. The goal is to move beyond simple return analysis and 
evaluate whether stock performance is justified by the level of risk taken.
</p>
<p>
This dashboard helps investors compare stocks using volatility, drawdowns, 
and risk-adjusted performance metrics.
</p>

<h3>Business Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Investors often focus only on returns when selecting stocks, ignoring key risk indicators such as volatility 
    and drawdowns. This can lead to choosing high-return stocks that carry excessive risk.
    The challenge was to create a single, intuitive dashboard that answers three core investor questions:
  </p>

<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Retail Investors</li>
  <li>Financial Analysts</li>
  <li>Portfolio Managers</li>
</ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Which stocks are performing well?</li>
    <li>How risky are they?</li>
    <li>Is the return worth the risk?</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Dashboard Features & What Each Chart Answers</h3>

  <!-- Risk vs Return -->
  <h4>1. Risk vs Return Analysis</h4>
  <p>
    This scatter plot compares stock returns with volatility (risk). 
    Each dot represents one stock.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>X-axis = Volatility (Risk)</li>
    <li>Y-axis = Period Return</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Stocks in the top-left area (high return, low risk) are ideal.
    Stocks in the bottom-right (low return, high risk) may not be attractive.
  </p>
  <p><strong>What this tells us:</strong> Whether higher returns are coming with higher risk.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- Sharpe Ratio -->
  <h4>2. Sharpe Ratio – Risk Adjusted Performance</h4>
  <p>
    The Sharpe Ratio measures how much return a stock generates for each unit of risk taken.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Higher Sharpe Ratio = Better risk efficiency</li>
    <li>Lower Sharpe Ratio = Return not worth the risk</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This allows fair comparison between stocks with different volatility levels.
  </p>
  <p><strong>What this tells us:</strong> Which stock gives the best return for the risk taken.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- Market Breadth -->
  <h4>3. Market Breadth Indicator</h4>
  <p>
    Market Breadth shows the percentage of stocks that are positive on the latest trading day.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>High Breadth = Most stocks are rising</li>
    <li>Low Breadth = Gains are concentrated in few stocks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Strong breadth indicates a healthy market.
  </p>
  <p><strong>What this tells us:</strong> Whether the market movement is broad-based or narrow.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- Drawdown -->
  <h4>4. Drawdown Analysis</h4>
  <p>
    Drawdown measures how much a stock has fallen from its previous peak.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shows downside risk</li>
    <li>Highlights crash impact</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This helps investors understand worst-case loss scenarios.
  </p>
  <p><strong>What this tells us:</strong> How much an investor could have lost during downturns.</p>

  <!-- Market Overview -->
  <h4>5. Market Return & Market Volatility</h4>
  <p>
    These KPIs summarize overall market performance.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Market Return %</strong> – Average return of selected stocks</li>
    <li><strong>Market Volatility</strong> – Average risk level</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Together, they show whether the market is generating strong returns and how stable those returns are.
  </p>

  <!-- Best and Worst Performers -->
  <h4>6. Best & Worst Performers</h4>
  <p>
    The dashboard dynamically identifies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Top-performing stock</li>
    <li>Lowest-performing stock</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This makes it easy to quickly spot leaders and laggards within the selected period.
